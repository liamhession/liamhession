### TL;DReadme:
I have a large variety of interests, and am putting great effort towards developing my ability to pursue a selection of those productively

### My past work
My professional career since 2015 has been focused on building the FoodBoss product - think Kayak.com but for food delivery services. This has served as a great opportunity to work on every piece that makes up a classical user-facing app (web and native). For many years i was the primary software engineer on the team, and my core contributions included:
- web crawlers for each delivery service we aggregated
- data pipeline logic for collating that data and making it searchable
- a REST API for use by both the website and the apps
- clientside logic for sorting results as real-time updates to our data arrive
- enabling ads on the platform, both display and in-line Sponsored Results

### My interests
- **Natural languages** - I have studied French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Hebrew. About half formally, half through Duolingo and online resources.
- **The next version of the internet** - I get a grim pleasure from hearing people express their displeasure about the contemporary state of the internet. The hope and promise of some new way forward has for years been my main motivation for following the blockchain space, and Urbit.
